## API Setup

We are using the [https://aqicn.org/api/](https://aqicn.org/api/) API  to get the AQI details.

The first step is to make sure to acquire your own token for all API access.

### [Get your token from here](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/)

Once you get the token create `src/config/Config.js` add your token in this file.

```javascript
export const Config = {
  API_TOKEN: 'Your token here',
};

```

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) `6.x` or newer
